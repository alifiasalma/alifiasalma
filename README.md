### **Hi, everyone!☁🌷**

I'd like to introduce myself. I’m Alifia Salma Nur Rasida and just call me Fia, please? I'm Statistics student in Sebelas Maret University. Currently, I'm in the third year of college and become one of the cohort student in Bangkit Academy 2023. In this occasion, I choose machine learning for my path because I think it will be so interesting and challenging. 

💬 Ask me more about **_statistics, data, and machine larning_**, so we can be friends to learn together! that funny, right?
