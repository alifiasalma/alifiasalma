### **Hi, everyone!☁🌷**

I'm Statistics student in Sebelas Maret University. Currently, I'm in the third year of college and become one of the cohort student in Bangkit Academy 2023. In this occasion, I choose machine learning for my path because I think it will be so intesting and challenging to learn.

Beside that, I'm so enthusiastic and still learn about data science and data analyze.

💬 Ask me more about **_statistics, data, and machine larning_**, so we can be friends to learn together! that funny, right?
